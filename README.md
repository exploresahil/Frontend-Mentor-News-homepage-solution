## My process

I try to keep my code clean and short.
I observe the design file first and try to define common veriables so that I can make defined veriables and properties.
I like to work in .scss file as it allows CSS nesting.

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid

### What I learned
